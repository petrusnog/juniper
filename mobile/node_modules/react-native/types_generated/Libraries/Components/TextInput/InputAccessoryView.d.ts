/**
 * A component which enables customization of the keyboard input accessory view on iOS. The input accessory view is displayed above the keyboard whenever a `TextInput` has focus. This component can be used to create custom toolbars.
 *
 * To use this component, wrap your custom toolbar with `InputAccessoryView` and set a `nativeID`. Then, pass that `nativeID` as the `inputAccessoryViewID` of whatever `TextInput` you desire.
 *
 * This component can also be used to create sticky text inputs (text inputs which are anchored to the top of the keyboard). To do this, wrap a `TextInput` with `InputAccessoryView` and don't set a `nativeID`.
 *
 * InputAccessoryView is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
